# websocket-sharp-example
This is a decent starting setup to use the websocket-sharp library (https://sta.github.io/websocket-sharp/) in an application which is primarily built for websocket connections. Built in C# .NET 5.0. Uses a WSServer class to manage the WebSocketServer library with a built-in message dispatcher using ConcurrentQueue. Uses a WSClient middleware class with its own per client ConcurrentQueue message buffer for sending messages. Client.html is used to connect to the running application once started.

A simple fast counter is used in Form1 to generate outgoing messages to the clients. Messages are generated quickly to demonstrate no bottlenecks. You will see messages when connected using client.html. It's recommended to only connect for a few seconds at a time since it could bog down the browser.
